# ESRB Wizard: Predicting Game Ratings & Player Engagement using Steam Game Data

**Contributors:** Cobean, Sarah · Khan, Obaid · Rangwala, Zaki · Riarh, Josh · Surjadhana, Aristo

This project explores how game metadata — such as tags, genres, pricing, and ESRB-like age ratings — can predict **player engagement (average playtime)** and reveal which features most influence a game's success.

Developed as part of **CP322: Machine Learning**, the project combines multiple datasets (Steam metadata, ESRB ratings, and API-sourced content descriptors) into a unified modeling pipeline.

## 🧩 Objectives

1. **Predict average playtime** using Steam game features.
2. **Interpret key drivers** of engagement using SHAP explainability.
3. Optionally explore how ESRB maturity levels correlate with playtime.

## 📊 Datasets

| Source | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| [Steam Games Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fronkongames/steam-games-dataset) | Core dataset containing price, owners, playtime, tags, and genres. |
| [Video Games Rating by ESRB](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imohtn/video-games-rating-by-esrb) | ESRB maturity ratings for merging via game title or fuzzy match. |
| [Steam Achievement Stats](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickgendotti/steam-achievementstatscom-rankings) | Engagement features (achievement completion rates). |
| [IGDB API](https://api-docs.igdb.com/#age-rating-content-description) | Optional: Additional ESRB content descriptors via API. |

## 🧠 Methods

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
   - Drop missing or zero playtime values.  
   - Normalize numeric columns (Price, Owners, Age).  
   - One-hot encode Tags, Genres, and Categories arrays.  
   - Merge datasets on game `Name` or `AppID`.

2. **Model Training**
   - **RandomForestRegressor** – Baseline model for playtime prediction.  
   - **XGBoost Regressor** – Advanced model with tuned hyperparameters.

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Metrics: R², RMSE, MAE.  
   - Cross-validation for robustness.

4. **Explainability**
   - SHAP analysis to interpret feature importance and direction of influence.  
   - Visualize how features like price, age rating, and genre affect engagement.
